// 1. Miles-to-Kilometers Converter (Operators):
// • Create a variable named miles and assign a numeric value representing distance in miles.
// • Calculate the equivalent distance in kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile =
// 1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
// • Store the converted distance in kilometers in a variable named kilometers.
// • Use console.log to print a message in the following format: 
let miles=130
//(1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
var kilometers = miles * 1.60934;
console.log(`The distance of ${miles} miles is equal to ${kilometers} kilometers`)
